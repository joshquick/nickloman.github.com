# Pan-genome construction notebook

## 31/10/2012

65 genome alignment has taken 9 hours to do nucmer alignments, and the MugsyWGA step is still running (~8 hours elapsed).

On to the visualisation on some test data:

* Align some WGS reads and metagenomics reads against pan-genome
* Write R script to display as heatmap (colour = coverage)
